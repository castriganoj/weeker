Feature: View goals for week
  As a goal keeper
  I would like to see my goals for the week to gauge my progress towards completing them now and over time. 

  Scenario: view features for the week

    Given I am on the home page
		And I follow "21"
    Then I should see "the current week"
    And the goals for the week should be listed below
    And the id should not display
    And A title and description for each goal should display
